# I2P-Secure-Design-Collective
Help us onboard the future of the Invisible Internet!

In 2024 we are focusing on documentation, community, infrastructure, standards and application developement. 

**Code of Inclusion**  This project prefers the insight of people who we can learn from as a way to break down barriers to entry to participating in the I2P network. We are interested in working with localization experts, policy makers, researchers, hostile environment trainers and digital security trainers. We encourage all participants to approach collaboration with an open and positive attitude. We engage constructively with others at all times and make an effort to speak clearly, avoid jargons and acronyms, and ask clarifying questions when needed.
