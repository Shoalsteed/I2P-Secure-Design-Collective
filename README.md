# I2P-Usability-Lab
Help us onboard the future of the Invisible Internet!

We are working towards areas of improvements in the following areas as outlined in Decentralization Off The Shelf: 7 Maxims:(https://decentpatterns.xyz/report/)

**Collaboration** Projects need to collaborate on a stronger, galvanizing narrative by leveraging strategies from campaigning and movement building.

**Design** Designers need new patterns and approaches for driving the development of decentralized protocols and applications.

**Infrastructure** Funders need to prioritize the independent verifiability and resilience of shared digital infrastructure, such as app stores, browsers, hardware, and networking.

**Developer onboarding** Developers need more accessible education materials and training modules for decentralized architecture patterns.

**Trust models** Projects need to design with vulnerable populations in mind, and adopt privacy and safety frameworks specific to decentralization.

**Sustainability** Funders need to innovate on strategies for sustaining projects and attracting talent.

**Governance** Technologies need to define governance models to align value and build a sustainable culture for long-term project value and stability.

In 2022 we are creating new onboarding for new I2P users, developers, and reaserchers. We have conducted user resaerch and began creating improved IA 
for the I2P Project website. Our work in progress happens in the UX repository.
