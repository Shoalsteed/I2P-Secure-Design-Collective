# I2P-Secure-Design-Collective
Help us onboard the future of the Invisible Internet!
Plain language approach to documentaion, and providing end user security through knowledge and best design practices. This project is the result of research and support from the OTF and Internews. All documentaion that we create follows guidance from our work with Superbloom,
Localization Lab, and outreach and work with digital security trainers. I2P is Free Open Source and available to people all over the world. 

We are working on improvements in the following areas:

**Localization**

**Collaboration** 

**Design** 

**Infrastructure** 

**Developer Onboarding** 

**Trust models** 

**Secure Workflows**

**Sustainability** 

**Governance** 

In 2023 we are focusing on outreach to the overlay network, privacy community, and digital security trainers. This will inform directions for improving resources, improving adoption, and finding solutions for issues around sustainabulity and infrastructure. We will also be focusing efforts on resources for I2P ambassadors. Blog component: https://theoverlay.ghost.io/

Code of Inclusion: This project prefers the insight of people who we can learn from as a way to break down barriers to entry to participating in the I2P network. We are interested in working with localization experts, policy makers, researchers, hostile environment trainers and digital security trainers. We encourage all participants to approach collaboration with an open and positive attitude. We engage constructively with others at all times and make an effort to speak clearly, avoid jargons and acronyms, and ask clarifying questions when needed.
